Client Objective

The overall objective of Rock-paper-scissors-spocky is to have fun while playing against the computer. Rock Paper Scissors is considered the oldest hand game in the world. In fact, the game dates all the way back to the Chinese Han Dynasty. This era began in 206 BC and ended in 220 AD. There are also accounts of this game in Japanese history. The earliest versions of this game consisted of a slug, snake, and frog. Rocks, papers, and scissors were used in a later version of the game developed in the 17th century. It wasn’t until the 1920’s that the popular Asian hand game made its way to Great Britain. In 1932, an article in the New York Times described the rules of Rock Paper Scissors. https://nationaldaycalendar.com/world-rock-paper-scissors-day-august-27/#:~:text=Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20is%20considered,and%20ended%20in%20220%20AD.
